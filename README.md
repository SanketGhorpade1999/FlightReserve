#### Database Model

There are 6 tables

- FLIGHT
- RESERVATION
- USER
- PASSENGER
- User_Role
- Role

There is one to one mapping assumed between reservation and passenger as well as reservation
and flight.

The role is used to classify different types of users for eg admin users and normal users.

User_role table creates a many to many relationship between users and roles. This means
we can assign multiple roles to a user and a user can be assigned multiple roles.
